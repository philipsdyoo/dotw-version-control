		<h1>Popular Pets</h1>
		<p>One of the most popular pets is the dog <svg class="pet-icon"><use xlink:href="pets.svg#dog"/></svg>. They have been domesticated from the wolves and have served as loyal companions for thousands of years. Another very popular pet is the cat <svg class="pet-icon"><use xlink:href="pets.svg#cat"/></svg>. They were worshipped since the days of Ancient Egypt, and we still keep them around as company. Another popular pet is the fish <svg class="pet-icon"><use xlink:href="pets.svg#fish"/></svg> since they are typically low maintenance and therefore popular with kids. However, some fish require more special care than others. We use them in science experiments, but mice <svg class="pet-icon"><use xlink:href="pets.svg#mouse"/></svg> can serve as pocket-sized pets. Another furry and soft pet is the rabbit <svg class="pet-icon"><use xlink:href="pets.svg#rabbit"/></svg> which are known to be gentle but also "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmu5sRIizdw">ferocious</a>". The tortoise <svg class="pet-icon"><use xlink:href="pets.svg#tortoise"/></svg> comes after the hare in this list, but they are surprisingly popular as pets. And last but not least is the bird <svg class="pet-icon"><use xlink:href="pets.svg#bird"/></svg> which comes in a wide variety. Some can sing and others can learn to screech profanities.</p>
